## How It Works

### Advanced Translation System

The bot utilizes a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to provide highly accurate translations:

1. **Context Retrieval**: When translating a subtitle, the system searches through a vast database of previously translated subtitles to find similar contexts and translations.
2. **Example-Based Learning**: The AI model is provided with relevant examples from the subtitle database, helping it understand context-specific translations and industry terminology.
3. **Enhanced Accuracy**: By combining these examples with the AI's translation capabilities, the system produces more natural and contextually appropriate translations.

This approach significantly improves translation quality by:
- Understanding movie/series-specific terminology
- Maintaining consistency in character names and recurring phrases
- Capturing cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions
